/* 
  Any of your custom global styles or default styles (like :root, body, a, h1, button) 
  should come AFTER the @tailwind directives if you want them to potentially 
  override Tailwind's base styles or if you want to use Tailwind utility classes
  within these global styles (though that's less common for global selectors).
  
  Alternatively, if these are truly meant to be defaults that Tailwind builds upon,
  they could be before, but it's more common to have custom overrides after.
  For now, let's keep them after.
